# This is my Fleet project

## I built it using the following tech stack - 
         1. React for Frontend (Additionally, used BootStrap 4 and FontAwesomeIcon for styling)
         2. Node and Express for Backend
         3. MongoDB as Database
         
## Summary of what the app does:
         - There is some JSON data about companies stored in the database in the 'companies' schema
         - On loading, the frontend makes a GET request to backend API to fetch the data stored
         - The frontend then groups the data by company name and displays it to user in the form of cards
         - User can search for a service by company name and the mode type
         - User can also update/edit a specific company's website and description
         
## To run the app:
         1. First go into the backend folder using command 'cd backend' 
         2. Next start the server using command 'nodemon server' (server opens at http://localhost:5000)
         3. Then start the frontend by running the command 'npm start' in the project's root directory (web opens at http://localhost:3000)
         
         There you go, my app will get running in no time!!
         
## I have deployed this app on Heroku. The link to it is:
